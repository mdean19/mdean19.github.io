                    <p>It's been ten years since Final Fantasy Versus XIII was announced, and since then it has gone through many large changes. It eventually became known as Final Fantasy XV, a mainline, numbered FF title rather than a spin off of XIII. It also went through director changes, which shows in the gameplay.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Graphics</h2>

                    <p>First and foremost, the game looks amazing. The graphics are great, the designs are very much in line with previous Final Fantasy entries yet retains it's own style. "A fantasy based on reality" which is very much shown in the game, as it blends fantasy designs with realistic designs. This is seen in the cities and landscapes, and certainly with the character designs.</p>

                    <p>Another thing I loved about the graphics is how detailed everything was. Chocobos never looked this good!</p>

                    <p>The magic attacks look great as well, with many particle effects shown to accentuate how strong they are.</p>

                    <p>While not the most realistic looking game, I believe it is still up there in terms of visual design. It is unmistakeably a Final Fantasy title, which is what I wanted most!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Gameplay</h2>

                    <p>The gameplay on the other hand, may not be every Final Fantasy fan's cup of tea.</p>

                    <p>The combat is akin to an Action RPG, and not so much like previous Final Fantasy titles. It is more fast paced and tends to be heavy on animations.</p>

                    <p>I believe that the combat is the most divisive element of this game, as it is so different from previous mainline entries.</p>

                    <p>Gameplay non combat wise is your standard fare RPG. Side content has you fishing, cooking, driving, all to make the game more varied in terms of gameplay.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Story</h2>

                    <p>Due to spoilers, I will not mention much about the story. To me, it was the weakest element of the game. Characters who you thought would be crucial would just disappear halfway through the narrative, never to be seen again. The final chapter is also very much a let down.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Verdict</h2>

                    <p>I give Final Fantasy XV an 8 out of 10. It is by no means a bad game, but if you're looking for a compelling story, you should look elsewhere.</p>

                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Brothers in arms.</span>

                    <p>Was it worth the ten years of hype? In my opinion, absolutely. Of course, no game could ever live up to insane amounts of hype that ten years could bring.</p>

                    <p>Honestly, the game is in my top five Final Fantasy games. All in all, a great addition to the series.</p>
